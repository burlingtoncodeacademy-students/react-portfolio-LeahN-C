          I have many, many interests. From yoga to crocheting to playing piano
          and writing songs to frolicking through snow with my pup... But more
          than anything, I love to fly! 
          <br />
          <br />
          In December, 2015, I went for my first
          tandem skydive, as a birthday gift. I loved it and right away decided
          to get licensed. I took a course, and learned to skydive on my own. 
          <br />
          I
          passed the levels, packed my own parachute and jumped with it, bought
          an altimeter and jump suit and goggles and a helmet, and then I got my
          A license! A couple of years and 39 jumps later, I decided to
          "retire", at least for the time being. 
          <br />
          <br />
          In 2021, I chose to start
          flying in a different way -- with Aerial Silks! I've been working hard
          and have built a lot of strength and flexibility. It's so much fun!
